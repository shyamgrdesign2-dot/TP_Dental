/**
 * Single source of truth for tooth-level diagnosis compatibility.
 *
 * Clinical mental model:
 *   - Missing / Denture / Bridge stand alone — nothing else coexists.
 *   - Implant replaces a tooth → compatible only with Crown (implant-supported crown).
 *   - RCT is endodontic treatment → compatible only with Crown (post-endo crown).
 *   - Crown sits on an implant OR on a root-treated tooth.
 *
 * Chips are NEVER disabled in the UI. Clicking a diagnosis auto-removes any
 * currently-set diagnosis that is not in its allow-list. This mirrors how a
 * dentist mentally re-classifies the same tooth.
